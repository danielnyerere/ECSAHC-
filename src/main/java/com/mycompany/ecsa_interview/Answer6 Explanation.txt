Comparison and Considerations:
Complexity: The complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because of the loops, where n is the number of elements .Space complexity is O(1).
Advantages: Simple to implement, straightforward instructions.

Solution 2: Using Sets (Optimized)
The Java solution using sets optimizes the search by using a set to store seen numbers and checking for the complement (target - current number).
